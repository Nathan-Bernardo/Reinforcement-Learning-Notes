# About
This repository is meant to help students, hobbyists, and researchers explore and contribute in the field of Reinforcement Learning. I didn't take interest in this field till summer of 2020, so I don't have the knowledge of an expertise in RL.  However, I spend a vast amount of time reading academic papers, looking into source code for many of the modern algorithms integrated in RL, and applying these algorithms in simulations for weighing out the pros and cons.  On top of these resources, I will be sharing my own tl;dr on academic papers so that not only I have an understanding of the paper, but so that you can understand the important features and outcomes without in depth reading.  With all said, I hope you can take something away from my exploration into the RL field.

# Getting Started 
RL is a difficult subject to specialize in since this particular field requires a good comprehension in *Linear Algebra*, *Probability & Statistics*, *Calculus*, *Machine Learning*, *Data Structures & Algorithms*, and *Algorithmic Thinking*. Don't be discourage because nothing is fun when it isn't challenging.
