# About
This repository is meant to help students, hobbyists, and researchers explore and contribute in the field of Reinforcement Learning. I didn't take interest in this field till summer of 2020, so I don't have the knowledge of an expertise in RL.  However, I spend a vast amount of time reading academic papers, looking into source code for many of the modern algorithms integrated in RL, and applying these algorithms in simulations for weighing out the pros and cons.  On top of these resources, I will be sharing my own tl;dr on academic papers so that not only I have an understanding of the paper, but so that you can understand the important features and outcomes without in depth reading.  With all said, I hope you can take something away from my exploration into the RL field.

# Getting Started 
RL is a difficult subject to specialize in since this particular field requires a good comprehension in *Linear Algebra*, *Probability & Statistics*, *Calculus*, *Machine Learning*, *Data Structures & Algorithms*, and *Algorithmic Thinking*. Don't be discourage because nothing is fun when it isn't challenging.  You must also be familiar with some python libraries, machine learning frameworks, and simulators for training your model and visualizing your results.  <br>

## Simulators 
OpenAI has developed these libaries called Gym and Safety Gym library, which provides an easy way of training an agent to perform a task and visualizing the progression after each episode as been performed.  Safety Gym contains a suite of environments that provide the researcher useful tools for measuring the progreess of their RL agents that respect the safety constraints while training (another field we call Safety Reinforcement Learning). A couple other simulator frameworks are Robosuite - powered by the physics engine MuJoCo - and CARLA - simulator for autonomous driving. <br>
